Requirements
============

In order to run cobramod *Python 3.7.4 or higher* is needed with the following packages:

    - cobra >= 0.18.1
    - request >= 2.24.0

Installation
============

In order to install cobramod, clone the development branch and install with using pip with the command ::

    pip install .

In order to use it in development mode, add the argument :code:`-e` while installing with
pip. This will make the original *src* directory

By default, required packages will be install when installing cobramod.
As mentioned by the original cobra developers, while cobramod is better while using a *conda*
environment, it is not necesary.
